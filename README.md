# Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia)

   The [ DataSet ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhiramakrishna/20bd1a6691-chest-x-rayclassification-pneumonia/data) is divided into training, testing and val sets,will combine them and randomly re-divide

## Tasks
   Main task is to understand and implement the basic Image Classification
   pipeline that can correctly predict the label of a given image and conduct the
   following experiments:

1. Understand the train/test splits. Even if the dataset is divided into
training and test sets, combine them both and randomly re-divide them
with at least 75% of data used for training. 

2. Implement sophisticated methods of feature generation (a minimum of 8
features are required for each instance)

3. Predict the outcome of the model for each of the following experiments
   - Train my model using any classification algorithm
   - Fewer features for each image, compare my model when using all features, half of them and then only 2 features.
